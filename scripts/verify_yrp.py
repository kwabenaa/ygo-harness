"""Check that a .yrp we wrote actually replays in EDOPro's engine.

    python scripts/verify_yrp.py runs/duel-100.yrp

Opening the file in the EDOPro GUI is the end goal, but it is a bad test:
it needs a human at a screen, and a failure shows up as "the duel looks
wrong" with no detail. This does the same thing headlessly and says exactly
where it broke.

It is not a simulation of the client - it is the client's own code path.
EDOPro does not store a picture of the duel; `ReplayMode::StartDuel` in
`gframe/old_replay_mode.cpp` creates a fresh duel from the replay's seed,
deals the recorded decks in file order, and feeds the recorded responses
back into the core one at a time. So this loads EDOPro's *own* libocgcore,
its own cards.cdb and its own Lua scripts, and does exactly that.

That makes it a check on three separate things, which is the point:

  1. our byte layout, since a misread field desyncs everything after it;
  2. our core's behaviour against EDOPro's, which is a different build;
  3. our pinned card scripts against the ones EDOPro ships, which move.

A replay that desyncs shows up as MSG_RETRY - the engine rejecting a
response as illegal for the state it is in - or as responses left over when
the duel ends. Both are reported. A clean run means EDOPro will reach the
same final position we did.
