# Experiments

Running log of what has actually been measured. Newest first.

Rules for this file, so it stays worth reading:

- **Record the conditions, not just the number.** A solve rate without the
  model, the puzzle and the harness commit is not a result.
- **Record failures and dead ends too.** Most of the entries below are things
  that did not work, and they are the reason the next person does not retry
  them.
- **Say the sample size.** Almost everything here is n=1. Say so, and do not
  write conclusions a single run cannot support.

## Model comparison on Master Rule 5 puzzles (2026-08-25)

Three models, both roles on one model per run, thinking left at each model's
default. `scripts/run_puzzles.py --model <id> --filter <puzzle>`.

### Home of the Fiends (2/10) — one run each, sequential

| model | result | secs | decisions | plan | re-plans | out tok | cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `google/gemini-3.7-flash` | **solved** | 254 | 17 | 5/7 | 2 | 35,818 | $0.085 |
| `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` | unsolved | 144 | 13 | 4/22 | 0 | 13,776 | $0.138 |
| `qwen/qwen3.7-flash` | unsolved | 532 | 12 | 3/5 | 2 | 112,617 | $0.015 |

### Seto VS Ishizu (4/10) — one run each, before the deck/menu fixes

| model | result | secs | decisions | plan | re-plans | out tok | cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` | unsolved | 199 | 25 | 3/8 | 2 | 18,482 | $0.208 |
| `google/gemini-3.7-flash` | unsolved | 359 | 38 | 7/8 | 2 | 31,510 | $0.109 |
| `qwen/qwen3.7-flash` | unsolved | 768 | 16 | 3/4 | 2 | 154,092 | $0.021 |

**What these support, and what they do not.** n=1 per cell, and run-to-run
variance is known to be large - qwen solved Home of the Fiends earlier the
same day under a bounded reasoning budget and failed it here. So:

- Supported: gemini produced a solve on the first attempt where the others did
  not; qwen is 5-10x cheaper than either; nothing solved Seto.
- **Not** supported: any ranking of these models by capability. Three runs are
  three anecdotes.

**Cost is not capability.** qwen wins cost by an order of magnitude and is the
only one that caches at these prompt sizes, but it also generated 3-8x more
output than the others and lost both puzzles. Choosing it is a cost decision,
and should be written down as one.

## Prompt caching by model (2026-08-25)

Two identical calls through OpenRouter, checking `cache_write_tokens` and
`cached_tokens`. **The harness sends an Anthropic-style `cache_control`
breakpoint on the system prompt** (`Provider.cache_system`); without it
nothing is written to cache at all.

| model | ~1.5k tok | ~3k | ~5k | ~9.9k |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen/qwen3.7-flash` | caches | caches | caches | caches |
| `google/gemini-3.7-flash` | no | no | no | no |
| `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` | no | no | no | caches |

Measured economics on a 9,926-token system prompt:

| | first call | second call |
|---|---|---|
| haiku | $0.012429 (write) | **$0.001030** (read) |
| qwen | $0.000335 (write) | **$0.0000291** (read) |

**Consequence for reading any cost number here.** Puzzle system prompts are
small - Home of the Fiends builds 1,497 tokens, Seto 2,330 - so gemini and
haiku costs in this file are entirely uncached and will stay that way until
the card corpus is much larger. The Sky Striker duel corpus (~3,900 tokens)
is the case where this starts to matter.

## Provider prices, OpenRouter, 2026-08-25

Fetched live from `/api/v1/models`, per 1M tokens. These drift; refetch rather
than trusting this table.

| model | in | out |
|---|---|---|
| `mistralai/mistral-nemo` | $0.019 | $0.030 |
| `qwen/qwen3.7-flash` | $0.030 | $0.130 |
| `google/gemini-3.7-flash` | $0.375 | $1.875 |
| `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` | $1.00 | $5.00 |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` | $2.00 | $10.00 |
| `openai/gpt-5.2` | $1.75 | $14.00 |
| `anthropic/claude-opus-5` | $5.00 | $25.00 |

Output dominates: a puzzle runs roughly 25k in / 30k out, so the output rate
is what decides cost.

## What "default" reasoning actually means (2026-08-25)

qwen3.7-flash, same planning question, only `max_tokens` changed. No
`reasoning` block — the model's own default.

| `max_tokens` | output tokens | reasoning chars | finish reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2,048 | 2,050 | 7,052 | **length** — cut off |
| 8,192 | 8,194 | 29,027 | **length** — cut off |
| 32,768 | 3,024 | 11,471 | **stop** — finished on its own |

**Default is adaptive and self-terminating, not unbounded.** Given room it
stopped at 3,024 tokens. Below that it does not think less — it is truncated
mid-thought and returns *empty content*, which is worse than a small explicit
budget because you get no answer at all rather than a shallow one.

Two consequences:

- `max_tokens` is the real limiter, not the reasoning setting. Raising it from
  2,048 to 32,768 is what let per-puzzle output grow to 112k-154k tokens.
- The figure recorded in `llm/models.yaml` as "default -> 1,331 output tokens"
  was measured under a 2,048 cap. It was a truncation artifact, not the
  model's natural length.

**Open, and worth fixing:** the executor runs at `max_tokens: 8192`, which
truncated in this test. It answers easier questions than the planner so it may
not bite in practice, but `stats.truncated` is the number to watch.

## Summoning costs in the primer (2026-08-25)

`Home_of_the_Fiends` (2/10, MR5). Four planners, one planning call each, same
prompt before and after adding Tribute costs to `RULES_PRIMER`.

The error the primer targets: three of four models planned "Normal Summon
Zanki" as a free action and then attacked with La Jinn — the monster the
Tribute consumes. The prompt already said `Zanki … Level 5`. Nothing said what
a Level *costs*, so the datum was present and inert. That is the same failure
shape as Main Phase 2 and as the graveyard past six cards: not bad reasoning,
missing state or missing rule.

| planner | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| sonnet | Zanki free -> claimed 3300, unreachable | **correct, 3700** |
| gemini-3.7-flash | correct | **correct, 3700** |
| qwen3.7-flash | illegal line | legal, plans 2000 vs 2400 — no lethal |
| haiku-4.5 | illegal line | *"I cannot find a winning line"* |

Nobody proposes the illegal line any more. Sonnet and gemini converged
independently on the same solution by different orderings, which is the
strongest signal available that it is the authored one — these puzzles ship no
solution to diff against.

**The floor rose; the ceiling did not.** The two cheap models stopped being
wrong and started being stuck. That is worth something — the executor will
walk a confidently wrong plan straight into a loss — but it is not a solve.

**It costs latency.** sonnet 142s -> 313s (30k reasoning chars), qwen 44s ->
94s (42k). The primer makes models think harder, and 313s of planning alone
eats a 5-minute budget.

### End to end, four runs

gemini-3.7-flash, hierarchical split (*not* `--all-planner`) — the
configuration that previously lost this solve.

| run | outcome | seconds | plan steps | out of order |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (solo) | solved | 212 | 6/6 | 2 |
| 2 | solved | 185 | 6/6 | 2 |
| 3 | solved | 283 | 6/7 | 2 |
| 4 | solved | 297 | 6/7 | 3 |

4/4, mean 244s, max 297s. Runs 2-4 ran three-way parallel and run 2 was the
*fastest* of all four, so the spread is sampling variance rather than
contention. One solve would have been a sample; four is the fix.

Under the 5-minute target — by three seconds at worst. Not comfortable.

**Still unexplained:** every run replans twice and takes 2-3 steps out of
order, including the two that executed 6/6. A plan that has to be rebuilt
twice on a puzzle the agent then solves is not a plan being followed.

### A harness bug found by trying to verify this

The first end-to-end run reported *ran clean 1/1, harness fault 0, no answer
1, solved 0*. There was no key in the shell: `provider.py` fell back to the
literal string `"not-needed"`, failed as a 401 three retries deep, and landed
in `no answer` — the agent-facing column meaning "the model declined to
choose", where a config error is indistinguishable from a useless agent.

Fixed in `ed2432a`: `.env` is read by `provider.py` itself, and
`NotAuthenticated` joins `OutOfCredit` under `FatalProviderError`, which stops
the run. The test asserts the key *resolves*; a "does not raise" test would
have passed against the bug.

## Things tried that did not work

**Unbounded planner reasoning made qwen worse.** Removing the 256-token budget
was meant to help it find multi-step lines. It produced 112k-154k output
tokens per puzzle, ran 2-3x longer, and lost a puzzle it had previously
solved. More thinking was not better.

**Routing every decision to the planner cost 14 minutes a puzzle** and did not
change the plan, which is where the reasoning actually happens. Reverted to
the hierarchical split; a puzzle now runs 2-5 minutes.

**A rules primer was argued against on the strength of a bad scan.** A scan of
368k characters of reasoning classified the model's mechanics claims as
correct and concluded rules knowledge was not the gap. It sampled claims and
never checked *turn structure*, which was exactly what was broken - the agent
planned an attack from Main Phase 2. The primer helped. Sampling a category
you did not think to look for proves nothing about it.
